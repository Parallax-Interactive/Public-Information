## Who are we?
**Parallax Interactive** is an ongoing group of talented individuals of various ages from all over the world who are collectively working on a new story-based horror trilogy. Planned to be released on all platforms besides mobile, the trilogy will go with a beginning-sequel-prequel format. Starting with Subject 9, a 16-hour multi-end survival-adventure-horror game, climaxed with Subject 10, an open-world game of the same genre, ending with Subject 8, a 6-hour horror game built to add the closure all stories need. With a building working team with more than 20 developers, we plan to start releasing in 2026, with a full release in 2027. Before then, we plan to start a publishing service, with the ambition to publish twelve games developed by partnered studios before our first real release
